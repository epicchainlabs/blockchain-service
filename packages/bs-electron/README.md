### Basic Usage

Here’s a step-by-step guide to integrating `@epicchain/bs-electron` into your Electron project for seamless blockchain functionality.

#### **Main Process Setup (main.js):**

The main process is responsible for managing the app’s lifecycle and initializing blockchain services. Below is an example:

```javascript
const { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron');
const { BlockchainService } = require('@epicchain/bs-electron');

let mainWindow;

app.on('ready', () => {
  const blockchainService = new BlockchainService();

  blockchainService.initialize()
    .then(() => {
      console.log('Blockchain Service Initialized');
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error('Error initializing Blockchain Service', error);
    });

  mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
    webPreferences: {
      nodeIntegration: true
    }
  });

  mainWindow.loadURL('index.html');
});
```

#### **Renderer Process Setup (renderer.js):**

The renderer process handles user interactions and communicates with the main process for blockchain operations.

```javascript
const { ipcRenderer } = require('electron');
const { BlockchainService } = require('@epicchain/bs-electron');

ipcRenderer.on('blockchainAction', (event, actionData) => {
  const blockchainService = new BlockchainService();

  blockchainService.executeAction(actionData)
    .then(result => {
      event.sender.send('blockchainActionResult', result);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error('Error executing blockchain action', error);
      event.sender.send('blockchainActionResult', { error: 'Error executing action' });
    });
});
```

#### **Renderer-to-Main Communication Example:**

Sending a blockchain action request from the renderer process:

```javascript
ipcRenderer.send('blockchainAction', {
  action: 'sendTransaction',
  data: {
    from: 'address1',
    to: 'address2',
    amount: 100,
    token: 'XPR'
  }
});
```

Handling the response in the renderer process:

```javascript
ipcRenderer.on('blockchainActionResult', (event, result) => {
  if (result.error) {
    console.error('Blockchain Action Failed', result.error);
  } else {
    console.log('Blockchain Action Result:', result);
  }
});
```
